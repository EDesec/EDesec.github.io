Resume is a simple Lektor theme ported from [startbootstrap](https://startbootstrap.com), designed for a personal site that showcases projects, research, and a blog.  
It ships with Bootstrap 4, jQuery, and Font Awesome 4, plus optional Google Analytics integration.

This repo includes example content to illustrate structure and layout. The theme is under active development and may diverge from the original over time.
